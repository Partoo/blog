I'm a full-stack developer living in China. I was obsessed with computer science in 2002 when I was in my college. During college, I used my spare time to pass the MCP/MCSE/MCDBA of Microsoft. I have put in a lot of effort to keep myself in the computer industry -- I worked as a graphic designer, so I can use Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects proficiently, and have a good artistic aesthetic; I have used ASP to make a website management system, and used ActionScript to make animated short films.

I really have a deeper understanding of programming after I learned about Laravel 3.x. I began to have a new understanding of SOLID principles and design patterns, and I was able to think the software development process from a higher perspective.
During the COVID-19 epidemic in 2022, I successively prepared system analysts and system architects for the China Computer Technology and Software Professional Technical Qualification (Level) Examination. Although the exams were canceled due to the epidemic, but it made my technology stack more enriched.

Now I am using SpringBoot to do some microservice-based experiments, and I am also planning to learn some knowledge of artificial intelligence.

Optimism, positivity, and enthusiasm are my labels, and I hope to have the opportunity to accept different challenges.
