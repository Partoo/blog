I was obsessed with computer science in 2002 when I was a  college student majoring in accounting. During college, I used my spare time to pass the MCP/MCSE/MCDBA of Microsoft. In order to be able to engage in the computer business I have put in a lot of effort -- I worked as a graphic designer, so I can use Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects proficiently, and have a good artistic aesthetic; I have used ASP to make a website management system, and used ActionScript to make flash clips.

The opportunity that really made me realize the charm of programming was after I accidentally learned about laravel. I began to have a new understanding of SOLID principles and design patterns, and I was able to think the software development process from a higher perspective.

During the COVID-19 epidemic in 2022, I successively prepared system analysts and system architects for the China Computer Technology and Software Professional Technical Qualification (Level) Examination. Although the exams were canceled due to the epidemic, but it made my technology stack more enriched.

Now I am using SpringBoot to do some microservice-based experiments, and I am also planning to learn some knowledge of artificial intelligence.

Optimism, positivity, and enthusiasm are my labels, and I hope to have the opportunity to accept different challenges.
